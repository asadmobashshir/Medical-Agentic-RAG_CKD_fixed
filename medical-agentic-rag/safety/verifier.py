"""Claim verification against retrieved evidence.

This is deliberately *not* "ask the LLM whether its own answer is right". The
procedure is:

1. Split the draft into atomic claims (LLM-assisted when available, sentence
   segmentation otherwise).
2. Score each claim against the retrieved evidence using lexical overlap over
   content words, restricted to the evidence ids the claim actually cites when it
   cites any.
3. Detect contradiction signals between the claim and its best-matching evidence
   (negation flips, and severity/direction disagreement across sources).
4. Label each claim supported / partially supported / unsupported / conflicting.
5. Strip unsupported claims that carry medical risk, keeping abstention over
   assertion.

The overlap score is a heuristic, not entailment. It is intentionally biased
toward flagging: a false "unsupported" costs a sentence, a missed hallucination
costs credibility.
