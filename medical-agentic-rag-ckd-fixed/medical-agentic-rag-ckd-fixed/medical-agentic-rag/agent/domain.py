"""CKD domain-scope classification.

This prototype is specialised for **Chronic Kidney Disease**. Its curated corpus
and structured store cover CKD only, so answering a question about an unrelated
condition would mean answering from model memory - exactly what the rest of the
architecture exists to prevent.

Scope is enforced *deterministically* here rather than relying on the planner
prompt, because the system is expected to run without a Groq key. The prompt
carries the same instruction, but this module is what guarantees the behaviour.

The classifier is intentionally crude and three-valued:

``IN_SCOPE``
    A CKD concept, a kidney term, or a drug this system actually holds data for.
``OUT_OF_SCOPE``
    A clearly unrelated condition or body system, with no CKD signal present.
``AMBIGUOUS``
    Everything else. Existing conservative behaviour is preserved - retrieval is
    allowed, and the usual no-evidence abstention handles it if nothing matches.

Only a confident ``OUT_OF_SCOPE`` verdict suppresses retrieval. A term appearing
in *both* lists (diabetes and hypertension are CKD causes, for instance) resolves
to in-scope, since the CKD signal is checked first.
